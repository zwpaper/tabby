# Config.toml

Tabby uses `~/.tabby/config.toml` as configuration file by default,
you can adjust various aspects of its behavior, including:

- API Endpoint
- Repositories

:::info
Note that Tabby does not create this configuration file by default - you'll need to manually create the `config.toml` file in your `~/.tabby` directory.
:::

An example configuration file is shown below:

```toml title="~/.tabby/config.toml"
[[endpoints]]
name = "openai"
api_route = "https://api.openai.com"
timeout = 5000
headers = {
  Authorization = "Bearer TOKEN"
}
user_quota = {
  requests_per_minute = 1800
}
metadata = {
  pochi = {
    use_case = "chat",
    provider = "openai",
    models = [
      { name = "gpt-5", context_window = 200000 },
      { name = "gpt-5.2", context_window = 200000 }
    ]
  }
}

[[repositories]]
name = "CTranslate2"
git_url = "git@github.com:OpenNMT/CTranslate2.git"
```
