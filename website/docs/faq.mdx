<Collapse title="Is it safe to put Tabby root directory on NFS filesystem?">

**No, it is not recommended to put Tabby's root directory on an NFS filesystem.**

Tabby depends on SQLite for its database operations, and SQLite requires proper file locking mechanisms to ensure data integrity.
Many networked filesystems, especially NFS, have broken or missing lock implementations that can lead to database corruption and unexpected behaviors.

For more technical details about this limitation, please refer to the SQLite documentation:
[Filesystems with broken or missing lock implementations](https://sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html#_filesystems_with_broken_or_missing_lock_implementations).

<Collapse title="How do I enable debug logging in the Tabby server?">

The Tabby server utilizes the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to control logging levels.
To enable debug logging, you can set this variable when you start the server.

For example, if you are running Tabby from the command line, you can do so like this:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug tabby serve
```

If you are using Docker, you can pass the environment variable using the `-e` flag:

```bash
docker run -e RUST_LOG=debug ...
```
