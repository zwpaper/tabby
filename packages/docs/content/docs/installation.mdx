# Installation

You can get started with Pochi by installing Pochi's VSCode extension.

### 1. Install the VSCode Extension

Install the Pochi extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabbyML.pochi).

1. Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
2. Search for `Pochi` and click **Install**.

Once installed, the Pochi icon will appear in your Activity Bar.

### 2. Configure an LLM Endpoint (BYOK)

Pochi operates as an AI agent and requires a connection to a Large Language Model (LLM). The primary way to configure this is through the **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model. This approach gives you full control over model choice, costs, and data privacy. Pochi account registration is optional with BYOK.

To connect your LLM provider:

1. In VSCode, open Pochi's model selection menu.
2. Click **Manage custom models** from the dropdown — this will open VSCode settings with Pochi's configuration highlighted.
<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
  <img style={{ margin: '0px 25px' }} src="/images/introduction/manage-custom-model.png" alt="Pochi's Built-in Tools" width="50%" />
</div>
3. Add your API key and configure your model in `pochi.customModelSettings`.

<Callout title="Max tokens & Context window">
  You can configure `maxTokens` and `contextWindow` for each model in custom model settings.

  `maxTokens` is the length of responses and `contextWindow` is how much conversation history the model considers. These values depend on your provider and chosen model — check your provider's documentation for the supported limits. As a rule of thumb: smaller values are faster and cheaper, larger values give Pochi more room to reason and remember.
</Callout>

### 3. Assign a Task

Once the extension is configured, you can assign tasks to the Pochi. Open the Pochi chat window and describe the task in detail.

For example:
```
Refactor the `ApiService` class in `src/lib/api.ts` to use `axios` instead of `fetch`. Ensure all existing method signatures are preserved and update error handling to use axios-specific error objects.
```
