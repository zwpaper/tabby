# Weekly Update #14

### TL;DR

This release introduces pair of upgrades aimed at making Pochi feel even more native to your development flow: GitHub Issue integration embedded right into task input, and a new `Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `Enter` shortcut to spin up worktrees easily.


### 🚀 Features

- **GitHub Issue Integration in Task Input:** You can now connect tasks directly to GitHub Issues. Typing `@#` opens an inline issue selector where you can search by issue ID, keyword, or scroll the dropdown list.<br/>

    All newly created issues are accessible within a minute. Once selected, issues appear as markdown badges and are sent as enriched context to the model. 
    
    **Note:** This feature requires GitHub CLI to be installed and authenticated. **[#833](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/823)**

- **Create a New Worktree + Task with `Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `Enter`:** You can now start a brand-new worktree and task instantly using `Cmd`+`Enter` (macOS) or `Ctrl`+`Enter` (Windows/Linux). When you submit a prompt with this shortcut, Pochi automatically creates a new worktree with an auto-generated branch name (based on the task description, falling back to a timestamp when needed) and launches a new task inside it. <br/>

    The shortcut also works when submitting messages with file or image attachments. In existing tasks, `Cmd`/`Ctrl`+`Enter` continues to queue messages as before. **[#822](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/822)** <br/>
