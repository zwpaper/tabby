# Weekly Update #19

### TL;DR

Another batch of updates is out. Here’s what we’ve shipped since the last release.


### ✨ Enhancements

- **New Pochi landing page:** The Pochi website now has a new landing page with clearer explanations of core features, workflows, and setup, making it easier for new users to evaluate and install Pochi. [#Visit Page](https://www.tabbyml.com/agent)

 - **Embedded bash outputs are now visible in the UI:** When workflows embed command outputs into the model context (for example git diff in the create-pr workflow), those outputs are now displayed in chat instead of being hidden as system messages, making it easier to inspect and debug what the agent is responding to.

### 📖 Resources

- We published a step-by-step guide showing how to use Git worktrees and parallel agents to run multiple tasks concurrently, with a practical weather app example that walks through setup, coordination, and best practices. [#Read more](https://docs.getpochi.com/tutorials/parallel-agent-guidance/)


### 🔥 Preview

- Along with Create Plan flow for new tasks, we’re also working on letting you choose which MCP servers and tools a task can access directly from the sidebar, instead of using a single global auto-approve toggle.

  Stay tuned!
