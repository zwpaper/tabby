# Weekly Update #16

### TL;DR

This release is still in progress, but here are some early previews of what’s coming.

Also, starting this week, along with weekly updates, we’ll now include key debates and decisions happening inside the team. If you want a voice in what ships, do reply to us in the links given below.

### 🔥 Preview

- Inline LLM comments are in the works. Leave notes on specific lines and the agent responds in context. These aren’t PR review comments, they’re AI discussion threads attached to code.

- You'll soon be able to choose the base branch when creating a new worktree, instead of being forced to use the current branch (`HEAD`). This makes it easier to start clean feature branches from main or any branch you prefer.

 ### 📖 Resources

 - We published Part 3 of our NES series, covering how we handle model requests while a user is actively typing. Read the full blog **[here](https://docs.getpochi.com/developer-updates/request-management-in-nes/)**.

### 🤓 Internal Tech Discussions

- **Do AI coding agents review the wrong coding step?** We’re debating a shift in how coding agents should be reviewed. Most tools pause the workflow to approve a plan before execution. 

   But in practice, plans happen before the agent has paid the cost of reality: before navigation, failed tests, dependency issues, and edge cases. The result is confident speculation, and not based on insights.

   We believe that the real checkpoint should happen after the work: reviewing the walkthrough, the diffs, what broke, what got fixed, and why. That’s much closer to how engineers review code today. We’re debating this direction and would **[love your input](https://x.com/mzh1024/status/2002023627232092358)**.

- **AI coding conversations should be append-only:** Instead of editing past prompts, the idea is to keep the history intact and fork from earlier points, similar to branching in Git.

    Editing history might feel convenient, but it erases the reasoning, the failed attempts, and the learning that happened.
