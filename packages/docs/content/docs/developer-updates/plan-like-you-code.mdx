We shipped **Plan Mode** in Pochi. 

Planning by itself isn’t new. What’s interesting is what happens when planning plugs into a workflow that already supports inline comments, review edits, and task-based execution.

Create Plan is a feature we built, but its real value comes from how it composes with the rest of the system.

Instead of treating the plan as something you just read and approve, you can iterate on it the same way you’d review a diff - leave inline comments, refine specific steps, and then execute directly from that agreed version.

The plan lives as a real workspace artifact (i.e. `plan.md`) and opens in the editor, so planning becomes part of the same collaboration loop as code.
