# Weekly Update #20

### TL;DR

As Pochi takes on larger and more complex tasks, it’s increasingly important to be explicit about intent and permissions. 

This release introduces new workflows for planning before execution and for restricting tool access per task, making agent behavior easier to reason about and safer by default.


### 🚀 Features

- **Create Plan Mode:** You can now create a task in Plan Mode to generate and refine an implementation plan before any code is changed. To use, click on the `Plan` option when creating a new task from the sidebar. 

   1. Plan tasks   generates a structured implementation plan instead of immediately executing edits.
   2. The plan is stored as a workspace artifact (i.e. `plan.md`) in Pochi’s virtual filesystem and does not modify your project directory.
   3. You can create a separate plan for each task without polluting your repo.
   4. You can use existing workflows: inline comments, review edits, and follow-up prompts to refine the plan.
   5. After review, you can explicitly start execution from the approved plan.

   This makes planning a first-class step in the agent workflow and lets you align on scope, approach, and risks before applying multi-file changes.**[#819]( https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/819)**

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Granular MCP Tool Control in Sidebar:** You can now control MCP access per task instead of auto-approving all tools globally. Follow-up messages are restricted to the MCP servers selected at task creation. 

   To try it out, look for the MCP server selector in the sidebar input. Servers disabled in global settings are not shown in the selector. This provides better security and more explicit control over which tools the agent can use. **[#939](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/939)**

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Token Coloring in NES Code Renderer:** Fixed an issue where certain token types (such as string literals) were not being theme-colored correctly in the NES code renderer. **[#731](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/731)**

### 🔥 Preview

- Soon you’ll be able to archive tasks in the sidebar to keep active work focused, with filters and quick restore when you need to revisit something. 

- We’re also building a built-in browser subagent that can browse and interact with live web pages and stream its actions directly in the editor.
