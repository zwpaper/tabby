# Weekly Update #9

### TL;DR
**Custom Agent** gets even better ⚡ + **i18n** upgrades for global users 🌏! And major Chat Sidebar UX upgrades are coming soon! 🚀



### 🚀 Features
- **Custom Agent with Slash Section:** You can now invoke **custom agents directly through slash commands** in the VS Code chat sidebar — just like how you trigger workflows. **[#567](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/567)**

This change unifies how agents and workflows are invoked, creating a more intuitive and consistent experience for interacting with Pochi’s capabilities.

</div>


- **Chat UI i18n:** We are bringing full **internationalization** to the chat UI!✨ Hardcoded strings are being replaced with our i18n system (powered by `i18next`), paving the way for a localized experience in English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. **[#201](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/201)**






### ✨ Preview

We’re actively working on a series of UX improvements to the VS Code chat sidebar, aimed at making Pochi more seamless and intuitive to use. 
Stay tuned for the upcoming update!
