### TL;DR

This week we brought **custom agents** to life!🐣 Pochi **CLI is on npm**, `newTask` makes it simple to create and manage tasks right from the terminal, and Mermaid diagrams render beautifully inside the app. MCP interactions are smarter too, and the docs and UI keep getting smoother with every update. ✨

### Features 🚀

- **Custom Agents:** Define your own assistants in `.pochi/agents` using markdown. [#176](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/176), [#181](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/181)
- **`newTask` in CLI:** Spin up tasks directly from the terminal, each with its dedicated agent. [#232](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/232)
- **Mermaid diagrams:** Drop Mermaid code blocks into Pochi and see them rendered as nice diagrams. [#255](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/255)
