# Workflows

## What are Workflows?
Workflows are step-by-step automation templates that guide Pochi through complex, multi-step processes. Think of them as detailed recipes that Pochi can follow to complete common development tasks consistently and efficiently.

Key Benefits:
- Consistency - Same process every time, reducing human error
- Efficiency - Automate repetitive multi-step tasks
- Knowledge Sharing - Capture team expertise in reusable templates

## Prerequisites
Before using workflows, you will need:
- VS Code with Pochi extension installed
- Local repository setup: Clone the repository locally to access workflows
- Workflows stored in the `.pochi/workflows/` directory

## Creating Workflows
Reusable patterns in `.pochi/workflows/`:

Example: `.pochi/workflows/create-pr.md`

```
Please help create a PR for the current staging changes, following these guidelines:
- If there are no staging changes but there are uncommitted changes, please stage them first.
- Create a branch name based on the current git diff status.
- Write a meaningful commit message/PR title.
- Use the gh CLI to create a PR.
- When running the push operation, it might be aborted due to a husky pre-push hook. For formatting issues, amend the files and try again. For other issues, try to resolve them as much as possible.
- The base branch for the PR should always be `main`.
- Always push the branch to the remote repository before creating the PR.

When creating PR with markdown description, pay attention to escape backticks, otherwise it will be executed as command substitution in the shell.

```

Example: `.pochi/workflows/review-pr.md`

```
Please help review a PR using the gh CLI:
- Ask user which PR to review (by number, URL, or from list)
- Use `gh pr view` and `gh pr diff` to examine changes
- Analyze code quality, security, tests, and documentation
- Check adherence to project coding standards
- Use askFollowupQuestion to let user choose:
  - "Approve" - Submit approving review
  - "Request Changes" - Submit review with change requests
  - "Comment Only" - Add comments without approval/rejection
  - "More Details" - Get additional information
- Submit review using `gh pr review` with appropriate feedback

```
## How to Use Workflows in VS Code
Once your workflows are set up, using them is straightforward:
1. **Type `/` in VS Code** to trigger the Pochi workflow selector
2. **Select a workflow** from the dropdown menu
3. Pochi executes the workflow automatically

For best efficiency and accuracy, always use the `/` command rather than manually describing the workflow steps to Pochi.
