# CLI

Pochi offers a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to run an AI agent directly from the command line.

## Oneliner Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://getpochi.com/install.sh | bash
```

## Authentication

The Pochi CLI uses the same authentication credentials as the VS Code extension for Pochi's cloud services. When you sign in through the VS Code extension, the CLI automatically reuses these credentials.

Credentials are stored in `~/.pochi/config.jsonc`. To authenticate:

1. Install and open the [Pochi VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabbyML.pochi)
2. Follow the sign-in prompts in the extension
3. The CLI will automatically use the same credentials

For non-Pochi models (OpenAI, Google, etc.), you can provide API keys directly through the command line options rather than using account authentication.


## Usage

You can pass a prompt to run a task:

```bash
pochi -p "What is the time now?"
```

Or pipe input as a prompt:

```bash
echo "What is the time now?" | pochi
```

For detailed usage instructions, run `pochi -h`, below is the output fom version 0.5.3

```
Usage: pochi [options]

Pochi v0.5.5

Prompt:
  -p, --prompt <prompt>   Create a new task with the given prompt. You can also
                          pipe input to use as a prompt, for example: `cat
                          .pochi/workflows/create-pr.md | pochi`. To use a
                          workflow, use /workflow-name, for example: `pochi -p
                          /create-pr`. Workflows can be embedded in larger
                          prompts, for example: `pochi -p "please /create-pr
                          with feat semantic convention"`

Options:
  --max-steps <number>    Maximum number of stepsto run the task. If the task
                          cannot be completed in this number of rounds, the
                          runner will stop. (default: 24)
  --max-retries <number>  Maximum number of retries to run the task in a single
                          step. (default: 3)

Model:
  --model <model>         The model to use for the task. (default:
                          "qwen/qwen3-coder")

Others:
  -V, --version           Print the version string.
  -h, --help              Print this help message.
```

## Debugging

To enable debug logging for the CLI, you can set the `POCHI_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
POCHI_LOG=debug pochi -p "What is the time now?"
```

This will output detailed logs about the CLI's operation, which can be helpful for troubleshooting issues.

For more granular control, you can specify log levels for specific components:

```bash
POCHI_LOG=Pochi=debug,TaskRunner=trace pochi -p "What is the time now?"
```
